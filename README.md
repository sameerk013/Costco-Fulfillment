Things to further enhance this code setup:
    1 Modularize the Terraform Code so that we promote the scalability and Reusability of the code. 
    2. Secrets should NEVER be in the code itself. I would deploy a Azure Key Vault and map the credentials there. 
    3. The state files should be included in github. Have them saves locally or on an azure storage. 
    4. Include DNS for the hosts as you should not be connecting via the IP Addresses. 
    5. Seperate state files so that we would override or corrupt resources that dont need to be included. 











If an existing data source existed:

data "azurerm_resource_group" "existing_rg" {
  name = "costco-logistics-fulfillment-resource-group"  # Replace with the actual resource group name
}

data "azurerm_virtual_network" "existing_vnet" {
  name                = "costco-logistics-fulfillment-vnet"  # Replace with the actual VNet name
  resource_group_name = data.azurerm_resource_group.existing_rg.name
}

Rewrite the resource group:

resource "azurerm_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  name                 = "costco-logistics-fulfillment-public-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = data.azurerm_resource_group.existing_rg.name
  virtual_network_name = data.azurerm_virtual_network.existing_vnet.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}
